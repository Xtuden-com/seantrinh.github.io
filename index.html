			<u><p id="about">About Me</p></u>
			<img id="me" src="IMG_0479.JPG" alt="me" align="left">
			<p>Welcome to my website, a project made with only a little bit of HTML and CSS! My name is Sean Trinh, and I am a rising junior computer science major at Stevens Institute of Technology, and I expect to graduate in May 2020. In the summer of 2018, I will be working as a cybersecurity intern at Lockheed Martin.</p>

			<u><p id="about">Where to Start</p></u>
			<p>On this website, you'll find just a few but convenient tabs for you to use. In the top left, there are tabs to my Facebook page, LinkedIn profile, Github, and Resume each represented by their respective logos. You'll also find a Home tab which will take you back to this page. Next to the Home tab is the My Game Picks tab, where I will be picking who I think will win each game during the NFL season. Lastly, I have a Contact Me! tab that will provide some information on how to get in touch with me.</p>

			<p>Below, I have some information available for you to learn more about me. Please feel free to check it out!</p>

			<u><p id="about">Academics</p></u>
			<p>I chose to attend Stevens Institute of Technology because of its prime location next to New York City, a city brimming with opportunity and a technological powerhouse, and its stellar program in computer science. There are many reasons why I chose to study computer science. Admittedly, I was initially drawn by the "hacker" that I saw in many Hollywood films, but I also fell in love with it because of my mom, who is a computer programmer herself! </p>

			<p>Within computer science, I am very interested in data analytics, cybersecurity, and machine learning. Although I do have an internship for this summer, I am actively looking to expand my network, make more connections, and hopefully obtain opportunities that would allow me to enter the financial sector, where I can analyze and leverage data to understand information and make smart business decisions, develop applications to protect personal, sensitive, and important financial data and information, and/or use machine learning to make advancements in high-frequency, algorithmic trading.</p>

			<p>At Stevens, I am a Course Assistant for CS 284 (Data Structures). I am also the Treasurer for the Stevens Computer Science Club, a Peer Mentor, and an active member of the Society of Asian Scientists and Engineers. During the summer of 2017, I conducted research here at Stevens for a project titled "Smarter Spaces, Smarter Campus". If you would like more information about this research project, below is a link to the paper that me and my team authored and submitted to IEEE UEMCON 2017. Our paper was accepted for oral presentation at the conference, held at Columbia University, and was awarded Best Paper in the category of Control Theory and Applications.</p>
